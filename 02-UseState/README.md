# React `useState` Hook

## Overview

The `useState` hook is a fundamental hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components. Before hooks, state was only available in class components. `useState` enables functional components to manage state in a simple and readable way.

## Syntax

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
